# py-todo

This is a simple command-line to-do list application written in Python. The application allows the user to add tasks, remove tasks by index, mark tasks as done, and quit the application. The tasks are stored in a plain text file in the user's home directory.

## Requirements

This application requires Python 3.x to be installed on the user's system. There are no other dependencies.

## Usage

To use the application, simply run the `main()` function in the `todo.py` script. The application will display a menu with options to add tasks, remove tasks, and quit. To select an option, press the corresponding letter (a, r or q).

When adding a task, simply type the task and press Enter. The task will be added to the list.

When removing a task, enter the index of the task to remove and press Enter. The task at that index will be removed from the list.

The task list will be displayed after each update, and the application will continue to run until the user selects the "q" option.
